Unfortunately, a portion of the site was destroyed when it was a plantation, a heartbreaking reminder of our historical choices. However, the resilience of the site shines through, telling a story that is 2,700 years old. This prehistoric metropolis was once the largest mound complex in North America during its time, and the people who built it were part of a massive trade network extending more than 700 miles.

Interestingly, the site of a decisive battle for Texas' independence, is just ten miles from my parent's house. This great state boasts some of the largest cities in the United States, and its economy rivals that of entire countries. But even here, I've faced discrimination and racism; yet, I say proudly, 'we didn't cross the border, the border crossed us'.

These mountains have been standing here for about 500 million years. Here, the early settlers cultivated cotton under the shadow of these mountains. Ross and I woke up early to see the sunrise over the peaks, an unforgettable sight. The Santa Elena Canyon, also in this park, was carved by the Rio Grande over millennia and is deeper than parts of the Grand Canyon. On my next visit, I hope to explore it.

Hiking it was an intense experience, with Ross and I exhausted after more than 8 hours of ascent and descent.

The Atakapa, indigenous tribes, were once the guardians of these lands. The park's geology reflects the Piney Woods region, a dense forest that extends throughout the southeastern United States. On our first night, we were surprised by a snake very close to our camp, reminding us to tread carefully. Despite rumors of alligators, we didn't see any during our early morning exploration, only a lake shrouded in morning fog.

Interestingly, this park was completely flooded when Hurricane Harvey hit the Houston area and took years to restore.

On our walks, Ross and I discovered Da Gama, now one of my favorite restaurants, in a then-under-construction shopping center. The Bayou, though lined with concrete to control flooding, still offers an urban escape. I wish there were more public spaces in Houston for walking and biking.

Although I don't have many photos from those times, those days are still vivid in my memory, including when I ran part of the trail along the lake for the Austin Half Marathon in 2018. Zilker Park is a paradise for dogs, perfect for flying kites and hosting some of my favorite events like Austin City Limits and the Annual Kite Festival.

Despite being a short hike, it can take your breath away, literally, due to the steep ascent and the number of steps to reach the top. It's a favorite spot for showing 'out of towners' a glimpse of Austin's charm. More than a viewpoint, this area is also the gateway to the beautiful hill country, a gift that extends to the west.

This personal connection made me feel closer to his story. Additionally, the park is home to an authentic German-Texan farmhouse, a reminder of the early German settlers. His wife, Lady Bird, leaves her mark here too as a defender of Texas's wildflowers and natural beauty. The park also houses the Texas White House and the presidential plane, both impressive.

Although the heat was almost scorching, we ventured to conquer the top of Wolf Mountain. The views were nice, but they would be even better on a cooler day. On the hike, Ross found a stone painted with a pink bunny, a touch of whimsy in this rugged landscape. At the end of the day, we returned to our Airbnb, enjoying the night around a fire when the weather was noticeably cooler. I can't wait to go back.",
        "parkNameForSanAntonioMissions": "San Antonio Missions National Historic Park",
        "introForSanAntonioMissions": "Tracing the history of San Antonio from downtown to the missions immerses you in Spanish colonial history: the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park. These missions, including the Alamo, were centers of community and devotion. Although it is debatable whether the indigenous people were happy to convert or coerced, there is no doubt that the missions shaped the region culturally and economically. The buildings and irrigation canals, which still function, bear witness to those times. It's interesting how the missions align, each one contributing something different: farming, ranching, and other trades. I would recommend visiting when the weather is more forgiving, as our tour was on an extremely hot day. Nonetheless, the tour of the missions and the canals was a unique experience. And don't miss Mission Espada, my favorite, where at sunset, a shadow seems to draw a smile on the ground."

        "stateName": "Utah",
        "introForState": "Utah, with its spectacular geology and impressive landscapes, is a reminder of the magnificence of nature. Originally, it was home to tribes like the Ute, Paiute, and Navajo, leaving their own mark on this beautiful state. The geology of Utah is a showcase of nature's artistry, with unique rock formations adorning the national parks. I have marveled at these natural jewels in three of the five great national parks: Zion, Bryce, and Arches. Every visit to Utah always leaves me yearning to lace up my hiking boots and explore again. The geological history of Zion National Park alone spans 250 million years, and each layer of rock tells a part of that story. Although I have come a long way, I still have many tracks to leave in Utah.",
        "parkNameForZion": "Zion National Park",
        "introForZion": "Zion National Park, with its rich history and culture of Native American tribes like the Ancestral Puebloans and Paiute, is a gift of Mother Nature's majesty. Here, waking up to towering cliffs and fresh air every morning is an awe-inspiring experience. With every step and hike through the park, one absorbs the beauty of the surroundings. The sandstone cliffs, in shades of red and pink, carved by ancient glaciers and the Virgin River over millions of years, show intriguing lines - the legacy of nature's power. At dawn, when the sun peeks over the canyon, the valley fills with light in a truly magnificent spectacle - Zion's magic moment. During the pandemic, wearing a mask outdoors became the norm, although in hindsight, it may look silly in photos (I wish I would have taken it off). Zion is one of my favorite parks.",
        "parkNameForBryceCanyon": "Bryce Canyon National Park",
        "introForBryceCanyon": "Bryce Canyon National Park, filled with hoodoos, those unique rock formations shaped by erosion, is a gem that I was lucky to discover on a detour on the way to Arches National Park. This unexpected encounter, nothing like what I had seen in photos, left me completely awestruck. Photos here simply don't do it justice. The Paiute people, the ancient inhabitants of these lands, believed that these hoodoos were 'Legend People' turned to stone. As you walk through the park, you can feel the presence of these ancient cultures, and one can't help but marvel at the sight. The park serves as a constant reminder of the power of nature and the passage of time.",
        "parkNameForArches": "Arches National Park",
        "introForArches": "Arches National Park, with more than 2,000 natural sandstone arches, is a geological wonder that shows us the evolution of Earth over millions of years. The Ute tribes, the first known to inhabit the area, left a spiritual imprint on this magical place. Although the detour to Bryce Canyon was worth it, I wish we had an extra day to explore more of Arches, given it's an icon of the National Parks. When we arrived, the sun was already beginning to say goodbye. The trek to the famous Arch was a race against the sun, more challenging than we thought, but we didn't give up. Upon arriving, the view of Delicate Arch was breathtaking. Sadly, our visit was short, before the dark trek back to the RV. Despite the lack of light and flashlights, it was an exciting and unforgettable adventure. Fortunately, we found other hikers with a flashlight on the way back, avoiding an encounter with snakes or falling off a cliff. No doubt, one day we'll return better prepared."
